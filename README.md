## **Who Am I?**
- My name is Aarush Manica
- I am from Melbourne, Australia
- I am 15 years old
- I have been programming for 2 years
- This is my second course from CS50

#### Description: This is a GUI-based application which simulates the action of registering an account and logging in. To make this GUI application, we use the Python library tkinter to create widgets and other GUI-components. This login system will useful in many different use cases such as logging into a particular account and managing user data. This system can also help certain applications in cutting down in spam entries and only allows a certain group of users to be allowed access to your product(s).

#### The motivation for this project was to expand and showcase my Python skills after 11 long weeks on watching CS50 lectures and completing problem sets. I knew where my skill level was and what was too much for me, but I decided that this project was the perfect balance of not too easy and not too hard. Apart from a few hurdles, I am very content and satisfied with my progress in this final project. I am proud of the progress I made in making this project.

#### Some challenges I faced were trying to figure out what components of tkinter I needed to use in my windows and how to implement certain methods and functions in my program. Eventually, I leaped over these hurdles by looking over some of my previous CS50 problem sets such as the problem sets for Flask and reading over the os and tkinter documentation. I also spent some time reading Stack Exchange posts to further assist me in this final project.

#### I would like to implement in the future a more clean design, possibly using Flask or Django as I feel this will improve the UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) of my application. However, that will be later on as I need to expand my skills in those fields as well as CSS design. 

## Programming Languages Used:

#### Note: You would run this application as any other Python application using `python project.py` or `pytest project.py`. I am also working on a Sphinx documentation and a video to help explain my code in precise detail. You can refer to that if you have any queries based on my code.
